# Playground
This is a TUI app to test the Wave Function Collapse on an example.

## Ideas
- add an interactive mode
  - Add a setting to switch modes
  - Extend the wfc implementation to allow collapsing selected tiles instead of everything at once
  - in the result screen, add a cursor, which can select a tile and provide the options to collapse it
